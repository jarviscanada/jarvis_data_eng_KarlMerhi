      - "JDBC App: Tasked by the team lead to learn JDBC Java library, DAO, repository design patterns as well as some advanced JDBC concepts. I implemented a JDBC application, in order to create a connection to a PostgreSQL database. The application allowed us to perform predefined operations to the database, for instance CRUD (create, read, update, delete). The project uses Java, JDBC, Maven, SQL, Docker and PostgreSQL."
      - "Grep App: Tasked by the team lead to implement the given JavaGrep interface, the Grep App is used to simulate the bash grep command, used for searching files in a given directory and match strings to the ones in the files.
