**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KarlMerhi/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KarlMerhi/tree/main/linux_sql)]: Developed a cluster monitoring system that is used to record system hardware information and compare it to the resources being used across different nodes every 5 minutes, store it in a database to generate reports for future resource planning purposes. This system was created using CentOS 7 for the Linux Cluster Administration team (LCA) and was implemented using PostgreSQL, Docker, Linux Bash, Crontab, etc...

**Business Website** [[GitHub](https://github.com/karlmerhi/Business-Database-Website)]: I made this application for a school project.

It is also a secure environment and there will be no information reserved after the end of the session. I suggest you view the GitHub link for a list of possible queries
